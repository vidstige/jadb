## The Checklist ##
If you want to help out and contribute to this Open Source Project, please keep reading.

My thought with `jadb` was to make it very light weight and easy to use as a developer.
This means as little boilerplate code, (mostly) self-documenting public interface, and
overall clean code.

Before submitting a pull request, please go through the below checklist to verify
your proposed change meets, or exceeds, the quality of the jadb source code.

* Builds - Make sure the code builds by issuing `mvn clean install test`.
* Works - Make sure all the test runs and passes.
* Works - Double check any features you might have changed, and of course any _new_ code
  by testing manually.
* Formatting - Keep the formatting _consistent_. Nothing
  fancy, pretty standard java stuff, check other source files
  for reference.
* Readability - Is your code easy to read? This usually means shorter code, but don't go
  full terse.
* Newline at end of file - This makes `cat`-ing files, etc easier.

Happy coding! I, the original author, and all users are grateful for your contribution. :-)
